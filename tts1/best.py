"""
Try to improve the accuracy of your retrieval algorithms. You are free to use
any techniques that you think may improve retrieval effectiveness, subject to
the restrictions. Use average precision (see task 4) to judge the accuracy of
your approach. Save your most successful algorithm as best.py. Output the
results to a file called best.top. Come up with a short distinctive name for
your algorithm and save it in a file called best.id. This name will be used
when we report the effectiveness of your algorithm.
...
Run your most successful algorithm (best.py) on the testing queries in
test.txt. Output the results to a file called test.top. Average precision (MAP)
on these testing queries will be used as the main criterion for marking this
task. You cannot compute MAP yourself (we are not providing relevance
judgements for the test set), but assume that MAP for the training queries will
be representative of the MAP for the testing queries.
